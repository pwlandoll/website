            Tomorrow is when I present my final project. 
            I'll start with a short <a href="/work/boo/Boo.pptx" class="bodylink">slide show</a> (alternative <a href="/work/boo/Boo.pdf" class="bodylink">pdf)</a> on Boo, explaining some of the basic concepts of the language. 
            Then I'll walk through my mid-sized program, and then demonstrate it with the booi, booc/mono, and booish commands. 
            After that, I'll switch over to Unity where I'll demonstrate the few scripts I wrote for the final project. 
            <br />
            <br />
            For my final project, I learned how to write Boo scripts for Unity. 
            I used one of the sample projects called Space Shooter, and wrote scripts to modify the pre-existing project. 
            The scripts include <a href="/work/boo/rgbColorChange.boo" class="bodylink">rgbColorChange.boo</a>, <a href="/work/boo/destroy.boo" class="bodylink">destroy.boo</a>, <a href="/work/boo/BooMover.boo" class="bodylink">BooMover.boo</a>, and <a href="/work/boo/BooWeaponController.boo" class="bodylink">BooWeaponController.boo</a>. 
            The first two scripts are attached to the main game player, and upon button presses, the color of the ship could change, or the ship could disappear completely. 
            The second two help facilitate the actual functionality of the game, specifically the enemy ships. 
            All in all, it was fairly difficult to figure out how Unity works from a beginner's standpoint, but after I got going it didn't seem so difficult.

            Now I'm preparing to present Boo to the class on Tuesday. 
            Since Boo is very similar to Python in many ways, I thought I would begin by opening a Python shell and Boo shell next to each other. 
            I would then demonstrate some of the differences in the commands, such as the print methods and Boo's static typing. 
            Then to give some examples of Boo, I would show the FizzBuzz and Pig Latin programs that I have posted below. 
            Since Boo is based on .NET, I thought it would be good to point out that there are some methods in pigLatin.boo that make use of .NET methods. 
            Then I could show that boo scripts can be compiled into executable files that can be run on any platform (on *nix systems through mono).

            Taking another stab at Unity today. 
            The tutorials online are helpful, but the whole thing is a bit confusing from the start. 
            I've chosen one of Unity's sample projects to start scripting with - the Space Shooter 2D project. 
            The first script wasn't that hard to copy from the website and implement. 
            With the game already built, I could attach a <a href="/work/boo/rgbChange.boo" class="bodylink">script</a> to the spaceship component and make it change colors based on keyboard input. 
        </p>

            In preparation for the final project, I've been looking at Unity. 
            After downloading Unity and opening a sample project, I've been able to familiarize myself with how Unity works. 
            Unfortunately, when I tried to make a Boo script that accomplishes the same thing as an existing script to pause the game, I couldn't get Unity to recognize the script. 
            Hopefully I can find more tutorials for Unity so that I can figure it out.

            The mid-sized program is complete! 
            <a href="/work/boo/pigLatin.boo" class="bodylink">pigLatin.boo</a> prompts the user for the name of a text file, reads in the contents, and translates all the translatable words in the file. 
            It then prompts the user for the name of the output file, then writes the translated contents, creating a file if it has to. 
            It consists of four methods and a main method. 
            readInFile() prompts the user for a file name and returns the contents of the file as a string. 
            firstVowel() takes in a string as a parameter and returns the position of the first vowel as an integer. 
            pig() takes in a string and an integer as parameters and returns a reordering (according to the rules of Pig Latin) of the string dependent on the integer. 
            writeOutFile() takes in a string as a parameter and prompts the user for a file name, then writes the contents of the string to a file of the specified name. 
            <br />
            <br />
            There are some great things about Boo that actually made this a lot easier than I had anticipated. 
            Some of the references I had found before were actually somewhat useless. 
            For starters, anything reliant on the Useful.IO library wasn't helpful. 
            I wasn't able to successfully import Useful so I had to look for other options. 
            The "using" keyword didn't seem to help much for file content manipulation, as I had hoped it would. 
            What ended up being the most helpful was the fact that Boo is based on .NET, so I tried using reference pages from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.file(v=vs.110).aspx" class="bodylink">Microsoft</a> to find ideas. 
            As it turns out I could use methods from .NET's File class, and my task was made much easier. 
            <br />
            <br />
            I also got to learn a little bit of regular expressions. 
            In the main method, the string of contents from the file is split by whitespace, which was easily done with a regular expression. 
            I also used a regex to check if a word was eligible for translation, meaning it matched the pattern of being only letters. 
            I also used regular expressions to replace a word in the contents string with its translation. 
            Making a regular expression out of a string is as simple as saying Regex(string).

    		This is going to be a little different. 
    		For starters, I've found that Boo has a quite annoying aspect for beginners - after compiling, the compiler sometimes says "more than one entry point found," but still compiles and runs (seemingly) fine anyways. 
    		I've also discovered that file input and output works in an unfamiliar way (see the example in the link below). 
    		I'll have to rethink the way I want to structure my mid-sized program so that file input and output will work.

			In anticipation of the final program, I've been looking at the Unity game engine and how to script with that. 
			From a beginner's standpoint, The Unity software is somewhat confusing, but not too bad. 
			I found a sample project on Unity's website - a 2D platformer/shooter game. 
			It looks like I should be able to write scripts to modify existing game components, such as the player's character or the behavior of the enemies. 
			<br />
			<br />
			For this week's class, I was to have an idea for a mid-sized program ready. 
			From what I've seen, Boo's .NET resources and typing allow for easy file input and output. 
			I decided to try writing a Pig Latin translator that will open a file, convert the words into Pig Latin, and write the translation to another file. 
			I might be able to make it possible to translate from Pig Latin back to English, but I haven't decided if I can do that yet. 
			<br />
			<br />
			I'm also interested in figuring out GUI programming for Boo. Since it is based on .NET, it may be possible to use Visual Studio to program a GUI. 
			<br />
			<br />
			Some resources for the program include:

    		This week I started to learn more about the language's behavior. 
    		From my experience with VB.NET last semester, I can see some signs that Boo runs on the .NET environment - for instance, the .ToString() method for casting integers to strings, as seen in <a href="/work/boo/fizzbuzz.boo" class="bodylink">fizzbuzz.boo</a>.

            Last week I started learning Boo. 
            Boo is a scripting language based on the .NET environment, and is used in the Unity game engine. 
            From what I've seen so far, it looks and functions very much like Python, but with a few different characteristics. 
            Boo scripts can be compiled into .exe files and run on Windows (or on *nix OS's with <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page" class="bodylink">Mono</a>). 
            The 'Hello World' program is simply &lt;print "Hello, world!"&gt;.
